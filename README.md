# PCVita
Laptop meets PS Vita. 
I'm documenting how I've turned an old gaming laptop collecting dust in my closet into a DIY Steam Deck for on-the-go gaming. To be clear, this is not cheaper than a steam deck by any meaningful amount, but this was a wonderful way to recycle something that would have gone to waste otherwise. Be enviromentally considerate!

Where I'm at:

Design phase! ü§ç

‚Äî

Most Current Update:

‚Ä¢ Case re-re-design to look more like the PS Vita. Rounded edges and a curved bottom shell for better ergonomics.

Sequential Updates:

‚Ä¢ Harvesting the vitals! Removed all components from laptop case.

‚Ä¢ Once everything was out, I disconnected daughterboards, hard drive, battery, and ribbon cables from motherboard.

‚Ä¢ Desoldered ribbon cable connector on the motherboard which lead to USB and Power Button Daughterboard.

‚Ä¢ Soldered magnet wire to (+) and (-) terminals of on/off switch.

‚Ä¢ Added NVMe M.2 SSD to replace bulky hard drive

‚Ä¢ Removed Heatpipes from heatsink shrowd. They extended the form factor of the motherboard too much for my liking. Using thermally conductive adhesive, I added copper fin heatsinks(rated at 401 W) to the shrowd.

‚Ä¢ Tested display output and installed Windows 11 + HP drivers needed to improve preformance.

‚Ä¢ 3D modeled motherboard into Fusion 360.

‚Ä¢ 3D modeled exhaust channel for the new heatsinks.

‚Ä¢ Edited exhaust model to include more effective turning vanes to minimise heat that cannot escape.

‚Ä¢ 3D modeled portable monitor into project

‚Ä¢ 3D modeled laptop li-po battery into project

‚Ä¢ Designed wedge 2DS-like case and moved components around to fit.

‚Ä¢ Re-designed layout to fit Wii U Gamepad model from GrabCAD

‚Ä¢ Case re-re-design to look more like the PS Vita. Rounded edges and a curved bottom shell for better ergonomics.

‚Ä¢ Figured out that a single USB port would not be enough to power the external monitor, USB wifi/bt adapter, and the microcontroller for the gamepad simultaneously. This meant that I needed to receive power from a different source. My plan is to use the 12v power output for the monitor backlight and use a buck converter to step down 12v to 5v. This way, the low power components like the USB wifi/bt adapter and the microcontroller can share the USB port via a USB hub.
