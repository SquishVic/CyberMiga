# PCVita
Laptop meets PS Vita. 
I'm documenting how I've turned an old gaming laptop collecting dust in my closet into a DIY Steam Deck for on-the-go gaming. To be clear, this is not cheaper than a steam deck by any meaningful amount, but this was a wonderful way to recycle something that would have gone to waste otherwise. Be enviromentally considerate!

🤍 Where I'm at: Design phase!

Most Current Update:

• Case re-re-design to look more like the PS Vita. Rounded edges and a curved bottom shell for better ergonomics.

.

Sequential Updates:

• Harvesting the vitals! Removed all components from laptop case.

• Once everything was out, I disconnected daughterboards, hard drive, battery, and ribbon cables from motherboard.

• Desoldered ribbon cable connector on the motherboard which lead to USB and Power Button Daughterboard.

• Soldered magnet wire to (+) and (-) terminals of on/off switch.

.

• Removed Heatpipes from heatsink shrowd. They extended the form factor of the motherboard too much for my liking. Using thermally conductive adhesive, I added copper fin heatsinks(rated at 401 W) to the shrowd.

• Tested display output and installed Windows 11 + HP drivers needed to improve preformance.

.

• 3D modeled motherboard into Fusion 360.

• 3D modeled exhaust channel for the new heatsinks.

• Edited exhaust model to include more effective turning vanes to minimise heat that cannot escape.

• 3D modeled portable monitor into project

• 3D modeled laptop li-po battery into project

• Designed wedge 2DS-like case and moved components around to fit.

• Re-designed layout to fit Wii U Gamepad model from GrabCAD

• Case re-re-design to look more like the PS Vita. Rounded edges and a curved bottom shell for better ergonomics.
