Laptop meets PS Vita. 
I'm documenting how I've turned an old gaming laptop collecting dust in my closet into a DIY Steam Deck for on-the-go gaming.

ü§ç Where I'm at: Design phase!

Sequential Updates:

‚Ä¢ Harvesting the vitals! Removed all components from laptop case.

‚Ä¢ Once everything was out, I disconnected daughterboards, hard drive, battery, and ribbon cables from motherboard.

‚Ä¢ Desoldered ribbon cable connector on the motherboard which lead to USB and Power Button Daughterboard.

‚Ä¢ Soldered magnet wire to (+) and (-) terminals of on/off switch.

‚Ä¢ Added NVMe M.2 SSD to replace bulky hard drive

‚Ä¢ Removed Heatpipes from heatsink shrowd. They extended the form factor of the motherboard too much for my liking. Using thermally conductive adhesive, I added copper fin heatsinks(rated at 401 W) to the shrowd.

‚Ä¢ Tested display output and installed Windows 11 + HP drivers needed to improve preformance.
